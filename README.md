# Mouse-and-Keyboard-Controls-using-OpenCV

Setup and requirements installation:
`pip install opencv-python pyautogui cvzone mouse numpy`

Features:
1) Right hand controls swiping left and right, which can be used in presentations and slides.
2) Left hand is used for mouse movement controls, and offers features for right and left clicking.
3) Only one hand can work at a time (beta-stage, eventually 2 hands will be implemented).
4) Code can be stopped using the `q` key or the `esc` key at the cv2 foreground.
